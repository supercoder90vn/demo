                    <p>What the tag cloud actually does behind the scenes is usually for blogs. The more common tag clouds are text links to various tags the user has set up on their blog. The tags are what the creator deemed as a relevant keyword for information in a post. As each keyword is used more and more for a post, the size of the text in the tag cloud for that keyword gets larger. Clicking on any of the keywords in the tag cloud will take you to a list of all the posts which contain it as a tag. The appearance of a tag cloud is set by CSS, but the function of determining which tags are most popular is done usually by PHP. </p>

                    <p>There are also some addons to various blogging software that makes the tag clouds according to categories of your posts rather than by keyword, and it works in the same way.</p>
